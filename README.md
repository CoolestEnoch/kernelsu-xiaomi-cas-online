## What is this?
Yet another self-compiled kernel for Redmi 9T juice series, integrated with [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org).

Based on [Sunrise Kernel](https://github.com/ShelbyHell/sunrise_kernel_juice) by ShelbyHell.

## Compatibility
Tested on Redmi Note 9 4G (China) with AOSPA topaz. It may also works for lime / chime device.
